# u04-todo-app

## SQL to make the project work
I exported the database instructions to the todolist.sql file.

## About the project
This is a todolist web app that allows you to store your personal todos protected by a simple login system.
The project is made entirely with PHP, using only a few lines of CSS since design was not a part of this task and i wanted to concentrate all my time on learning PHP.
